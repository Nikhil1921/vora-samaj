							<p>The festival of lights Diwali has been around for a long time. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Rama returned home to Ayodhya on this day after killing the demon king Ravana. Upon the arrival of their king, the residents of Ayodhya lighted the streets and houses with oil lamps to celebrate the occasion. Since then, the Hindus have been following the tradition by celebrating the festival with pomp and fervor. It is easily the favorite festival for kids as they get to eat their favorite sweets and wear new clothes.</p>
							<p>
							The festival teaches us that good always wins over evil and that we must eradicate darkness with light. A festive atmosphere can be seen during Diwali in every Indian household. Everyone is busy cleaning houses, preparing sweets, or lighting up lamps. A religious ceremony usually precedes the celebrations in the evening.</p>
